a)
pro: It does not need any server connection, therefore getting your token won't be bounded
by having Internet connection (if you are on a plane for instance).

con: There might be a situation where your token must be updated to a new token (by the people 
behind the server) for some reason, and if you don't ask the server for updates every time 
you log-in, you would be using an unidentified token.

b)
pro: You would always be up to date since there might be a change in your token by the people
behind the server (if they decided to use a token of 20 letters and not 15...)

con: You would always need to be connected to the Internet and have access to their server API
which, sometimes, you won't always have.
